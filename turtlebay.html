            <p tabindex="0"> This is a four station interactive that I created during my time at Ideum for the City of
                Redding and the Turtle Bay Exploration Park.</p>
            <p>A full portfolio video can be found on <a href="https://ideum.com/portfolio/turtlebay-custom-software"
                    target="_blank">Ideums Website</a></p>
            <p tabindex="0">It consisted of an ArcGIS map explorer that visitors could use to learn about the diffenent
                utilites in the area, as well as important landmarks</p>
            <p> There were also a few different interactive scenes to help visitors learn about how things they may do
                every day might effect the local community.</p>
