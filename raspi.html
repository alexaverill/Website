      <h1 tabindex="0">Raspberry Pi Kits</h1>
      <p>These Raspberry Pi Kits are a computer science outreach kit designed to be lower cost and portable for use
        within schools, libraries, and afterschool programs. They were designed to reach an audience from upper
        elemetary to high school students.
      <p>The kits contain all the hardware needed for complete Raspberry Pi Computer setups. I also designed
        instructional guides for students to follow along with, allowing them to experience and experiment with
        different types of computer science.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="piTitle">Getting Started with Raspberry Pi</span> - This is the starting point of all the
          activities. It walks students through setting up and getting started with the Raspberry Pi Computers.</li>
        <li><span class="piTitle">Experiments with Programming</span> - Using a modified version of KanoOS, students
          can experiment with graphical programming, using linux commands, and controlling programs through the
          command line.</li>
        <li><span class="piTitle">Wired Wearables </span>- Using the SEEC Arduino Lilypad and an Arduino Lilypad,
          students can practice programming with wearable electronics in a non-intimidating way.</li>
        <li><span class="piTitle">Getting Started with Sense Hat</span> - Using the Raspberry Pi Sense Hat, students
          will learn to create a basic game using the LED grid and also learn to read a multitude of sensors. </li>
      </ul>
