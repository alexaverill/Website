                <p>The Michigan Naturalist Table is an exhibit for the brand new University of Michican Natural History
                    musuem. This was developed at <a href="https://ideum.com/">Ideum</a>, for more specific information
                    check out the description on <a href="https://ideum.com/portfolio/rfid-table">their portfolio</a>.
                    The main goal of this exhibit was to allow more of the museums collection to be viewed and explored
                    by vistors.</p>
                <p>The exhibit consists of 20 different specimens, and one specimen viewing station. Visitors will
                    select a specimen that they are interested in and take it to the speciment viewing station, once a
                    specimen is placed on the viewing station that specimens information will appear on the screen. The
                    viewing station contains information about each specimen, leading questions to help visitors examine
                    the specimen they chose, and unique and engaging media peices. </p>

                <h2>How it works?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>One of the goals of the Michigan Natural History museum was for this experiance to be
                    &quot;magical&quot; and not require much user input. Each specimen in the collection is tagged with
                    tag that has an embed RFID tag. Inside the cusom exhibit cabinetry there is an embed RFID reader
                    that will read the RFID tag as the specimen is placed on the shelf. </p>
                <p>We were able to achieve approximently 18-24 inches of read distance above the shelf at full RFID
                    reader power, and ended up aiming for approximently 3 inches above the shelf as the optimal read
                    distance.</p>
                <p>We did discover an interesting issue during taping of the exhibit. If the plastic piece of the shelf
                    was rubbed vigorously (such as wiping off smudges or finger prints) it would cause the RFID reader
                    to stop functioning. What I discovered was that as the plastic was being rubbed it would start to
                    build up a static charge, and once that reached its peak it would be able to jump the small cap
                    between the plastic and the RFID reader and cause the USB protection to trigger causing the RFID
                    reader to stop functioning. Luckily this able to be remidied by simply grounding the mounting screws
                    for the RFID into the computers power supply and the issue was resolved. </p>

                <h2 id="accessiblity">Accessiblity</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>One concern for this exhibit was to make it as accesible as possible. A unique feature of this
                    exhibit was to include an accessbility shortcut layer to allow a visitor to view a specimen without
                    nessisarily having to select it off of the shelves that surround the viewer. If a visitor holds
                    three fingers down on the screen it will activate a list view of the different specimens that are
                    available to view. Additionally instructions on how to access this view is included in the
                    information that appears in the about window. </p>
                <p>In order to also allow for easy access to the interactive for small children or those in a wheelchair
                    careful consideration was taken with placement of the User Interface to the bottom half of the
                    screen. Even with the angle of the screen this allows the majority of visitors to be able to easily
                    interact with the exhibit. </p>
                <h2>Managing Content</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Due to the amount of information on each specimen as the high likelyhood of specimens being swapped
                    out, removed, or added, a Content Managment System (CMS) was also created. This CMS allowed for the
                    addition, removal, and updating of specimens and their related information. This allows the curators
                    and musuem staff to keep the exhibit up to date in an easy and user friendly manner. </p>
