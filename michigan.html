                    <p>The Michigan Naturalist Table is an exhibit for the brand new <a
                            href="https://lsa.umich.edu/ummnh">University of Michican Natural History musuem</a>. This
                        was developed at <a href="https://ideum.com/">Ideum</a> - for more specific information check
                        out the description on <a href="https://ideum.com/portfolio/rfid-table">their portfolio</a>. The
                        main goal of this exhibit was to allow visitors to view details about the museum&#39;s
                        collection easily and with a touch of magic. </p>
                    <p>The exhibit consists of 20 different specimens and one specimen viewing station. Visitors will
                        select a specimen that they are interested in and take it to the speciment viewing station. Once
                        a specimen is placed on the viewing station, that specimen&#39;s information will appear on the
                        screen. The viewing station contains information about each specimen, questions to help visitors
                        investigate the specimen they chose, and unique and engaging media pieces. </p>

                    <h2>How it works?</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>One of the goals of the Michigan Natural History museum was for this experience to be
                        &quot;magical&quot; and not require much user input. Each specimen in the collection has an
                        RFID-embedded tag. Inside the custom exhibit cabinetry, there is an RFID reader that will read
                        the RFID tag as the specimen is placed on the shelf. </p>
                    <p>We were able to achieve approximately 18-24 inches of read distance above the shelf at full RFID
                        reader power, and ended up aiming for 3 inches above the shelf as the optimal read distance.</p>
                    <p>We did discover an interesting issue during taping of the exhibit. If the plastic piece of the
                        shelf was rubbed vigorously (such as wiping off smudges or finger prints), it would cause the
                        RFID reader to stop functioning. What I discovered was that as the plastic was being rubbed, it
                        would start to build up a static charge. Once that reached its peak, it would jump the small gap
                        between the plastic and the RFID reader and cause the USB protection to trigger. This caused the
                        RFID reader to stop functioning. Luckily, I remedied this by simply grounding the RFID&#39;s
                        mounting screws into the computer&#39;s power supply. </p>

                    <h2>Accessiblity</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>One concern for this exhibit was to make it as accessible as possible. My team and I designed an
                        accessbility shortcut layer that allowed a visitor to view a specimen without necessarily having
                        to select it off of the shelves. If a visitor holds three fingers down on the screen, it will
                        activate a list view of the different specimens available for viewing. Additionally,
                        instructions on how to access this view is included in the information that appears in the about
                        window. </p>
                    <h2 id="managing-content">Managing Content</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Due to the amount of information on each specimen, as well as the high likelihood of specimens
                        being swapped out, removed, or added, I developed a Content Managment System (CMS). This CMS
                        allowed for the addition, removal, and updating of specimens and their related information. This
                        allows the curators and musuem staff to keep the exhibit up-to-date in an easy and user-friendly
                        manner. </p>
