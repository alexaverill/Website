                <h1>Constellations Animation</h1>
                <canvas id="mainCanvas"></canvas>
                <p>The Constellations animation above was a fun weekend project to get my feet wet with Javascript and web programming after 
                    spending most of my days working in Unity or QT/C++. 
                     I ended up using Typescript and the Canvas element to re-create a common animation seen around the web. Typescript made the transition from C++/C# much smoother then jumping straight back into Javascript </p>
                <p>This animation consists of a set of randomly moving points, and a known max seperation distance for when to render the lines. I did have some trouble getting the canvas to play nice with resizing screens and being responsive. </p>
                
                <p>Some potential future work:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Implement a gradient on each line based on length</li>
                    <li>Combine the lines with my a boid implentation I did a while ago to just to see what happens</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In addition to the Javascript implementation above I also spend some time implementing the same type
                    of animation as a way to get more familiar with Godot. <a
                        href="https://github.com/alexaverill/ParticleFun">The Godot animation can be found on
                        github</a>.</p>
