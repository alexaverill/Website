                <h1>Constellations Animation</h1>
                <canvas id="mainCanvas" width="1300%" ; height="600%"></canvas>
                <p>The Constellations animation above was a fun re-introduction back into Javascript after spending a
                    lot of time on the Desktop side of things.This type of animation seems to be appearing randomly
                    around the web as a simple background animation that looks interesting without being distracting.
                    Based on spending most of my recent time in C# and C++ I decided to give Typescript a try. I really
                    enjoyed how quickly I was able to get it setup and running without having to deal with any headache,
                    or incredibly long installation processes (looking at you QT).</p>
                <p>Overall the entire animation is incredibly straightforward to program. It consists of a randomly
                    moving set of points, and lines that connect each point based on the seperation distance between
                    each point. Once the movement is implemented it is as simple and calculting the distance between
                    points and drawing a line if it is less then the seperation distance. </p>
                <p>After I had the initial animation funcitioning and looking nice, I started to play with making the
                    entire thing somewhat reactive to the page size. It was an interesting challenge dealing with the
                    number of possible ways to get the actual window width. As well as totally forgetting about reseting
                    page margin and padding and getting frustrated with the 8 pixel border around my canvas. </p>
                <p>Some potential future work:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Implement a gradient on each line based on length</li>
                    <li>Combine the lines with my a boid implentation I did a while ago to just to see what happens</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In addition to the Javascript implementation above I also spend some time implementing the same type
                    of animation as a way to get more familiar with Godot. <a
                        href="https://github.com/alexaverill/ParticleFun">The Godot animation can be found on
                        github</a>.</p>
