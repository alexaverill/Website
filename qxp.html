                <p>The Qualcomm Future of Medicine Table (It was called many things during development) was an exhbit
                    that was developed at <a href="https://ideum.com/">Ideum</a> (<a
                        href="https://ideum.com/portfolio/xprize-tricorder-museum-exhibit">Ideum Portfolio Piece</a>)in
                    collaboration with the <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">Qualcomm XPrize
                        Foundation</a> to help expand the publics knowledge of the work of the Qualcomm XPrize
                    foundation as well as their medical device challege that ended in 2017. This exhibit was deployed
                    into four different science centers all across the United States. </p>
                <p>This application consisted of three different programs that operated on the same table, embeded
                    health sensors that communicated with the application, and finally a set of LEDs embeded in the
                    table to provide a futuristic look. The application was developed in Unity, along with an Arduino
                    that interfaced with the different health sensors. </p>
                <p>This was an extremely fun and rewarding exhibit to work on and was deployed to five different science
                    centers across the nation. </p>

                        <hr>
                <p>My main focus for this exhibit was the Sense Yourself portion of the application. Sense Yourself
                    consisted of three different health sensors that allowed a visitor to see live statistics about
                    their current health.</p>
                <p>The three finger activated sensors lived in a custom enclosure attached to an Ideum touch table. When
                    a sensor was touched it would activate a differnt view focusing on that sensor in the Application.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Heart Rate Sensor</strong> </p>
                <p>On the far left of the panel lived a heart rate sensor that would read and display the visitors
                    current heart rate. This ended up being the most difficult of the three sensors to integrate. The
                    main challenge was the tradeoff between speed and accuracy of the sensor, the longer a finger was
                    placed on the sensor the more accurate and reliabe the output would be to the actual heartrate of a
                    visitor. A truly accurate reading at a worst case could approach 20 seconds of read time, which for
                    a musuem exhibit is a very long time. </p>
                <p>In order to try to ensure accurate readings and avoid frustrated vistors a number of different things
                    were implemented to this portion of the application. The first was a countdown to inform the visitor
                    of the state of the scan so that they wouldn&#39;t assume it was broken. The second was a prompt to
                    retry the scan if the readings at the end of the countdown were unreasonably high or low which would
                    indicate a poor reading from the sensor.</p>
                <p>Once a heart rate was read the application would prompt the user to do some form of exercise to see
                    if they could increase their heart rate.</p>
                <p><strong>Galvonic Skin Response (Stress)</strong> </p>
                <p>The middle sensor was a galvonic skin response sensor, it measures the amount of moisture on the skin
                    and uses that as a correlation to the amount of stress a visitor is experiancing. This sensor was
                    extremely easy to integrate, and allowed us to graph the visitors stress level as indicated by the
                    sensor. </p>
                <p>Once a visitor places their finger onto this sensor the application would display a running line
                    graph displaying the users current stress level as read by the Galvonic Skin response. It would then
                    prompt the visitor to either attempt to calm down, or to do something embarressing to see how their
                    stress level changed.</p>
                <p><strong>Temperature Sensor</strong> </p>
                <p>The rightmost sensor was a IR Temperature sensor meant to read and display the skin temperature of
                    the visitor. This contactless temperature sensor was also extremely easy to integate into the
                    aplication and provided a very accurate and repeatable skin temperature reading. </p>
                <p>Once the skin temperature was displayed to the visitor it would prompt them to rub thier hands
                    together to see if they could increase their temperature, as well as an explaination as to the
                    reasons the temperature may not have been what they were expecting. This additional explaination was
                    added after user testing where visitors were confused as to why the temperature they were seeing was
                    not the usual 98.6 degrees</p>
