            <h2>Recipe Generator</h2>
            <p>My partner and I had been having issues trying to keep track of our collection of recipes that we had
                been building up from family members, cookbooks, and random internet sites.</p>
            <p>We had tried using a couple of different apps, but had the problem that we wanted a paper version so we
                could easily have it open in the kitchen, and mark it up as we iterated/improved the recipe. </p>
            <p>Our main goals were to have something easy to edit and update, and have a quick process to create a new
                paper version without much effort. We decided that our base recipes should be stored as markdown, which
                solved the easily editable issue.</p>
            <p> I then decided that we should just convert those markdown files to HTML (using MarkDig) and then used
                Playwright to print them
                to PDF. During the Playwright Print to PDF portion I injected custom styles that controlled the recipe
                layout.</p>
            <p>To create recipe PDFs you would put your markdown files into the markdown folder and then run docker
                compose up and PDFs would be spit out into a PDFs folder.</p>
            <p> View the code on the <a href="https://github.com/alexaverill/RecipeGenerator/tree/main">Recipe Generater
                    Github</a></p>
            <p> One downside was that we wanted to have some custom elements to make the printed recipe a bit more
                elegant, so we had some non-standard markdown added that markdig would convert to divs. Sample Markdown:
            <pre><code>
                    :::::container
                    ::::topbar
                    ::::
                    ::::main
                    :::title{.gold-banner}
                    # Alfredo Sauce
                    :::
                    :::ingredients
                    ## Ingredients
                    - 1/2 cup butter
                    - 1 pint heavy whipping cream
                    - 4 oz of cream cheese
                    - 1/2 tsp of minced garlic
                    - 1 cup of parmesan
                    - Garlic powder
                    - Italian seasoning
                    - Flour (for thickening)
                    :::
                    :::recipe
                    ## Recipe
                    1. Add butter, cream, and cream cheese into a sauce pan and melt.
                    2. Season to taste with garlic powder, italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
                    3. Add shredded cheese. Bring to a simmer and cook for 3-5 minutes, constantly stirring, until thick.
                    4. Add flour for extra thickness if needed.
