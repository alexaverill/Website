            <h2 tabindex="0">Family Recipe App</h2>
            <p>We weren't totally satisfied by our paper recipe process (See the <a
                    href="./2022-recipe-generator.html">Recipe Generator</a>), so decided that we should build something
                a bit different. View the source on the <a href="https://github.com/alexaverill/FamilyRecipeApp">Family
                    Recipe App Github</a></p>
            <p> Our main issues we were having were:
            <ul>
                <li>It was hard to quickly edit, you had to write down your changes, then edit markdown, then reprint
                    the recipe</li>
                <li>It was hard to share, if you wanted to share a single recipe you had to either manually run the
                    process for the single recipe, or print a single page from the generated PDF and then share.</li>
                <li>It wasn't easy for anyone in our family to add their recipes, they would have to share it with us
                    and then we would add it and send it back</li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <p> These problems led us to decide to build a basic web app that anyone in our families could log in to and
                add or view recipes. It had a few main requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>It needed to be easy to create recipes</li>
                <li>It needed to be easy to edit recipes</li>
                <li>Recipes should be easy to find</li>
                <li>It should be easy to create a variation of another persons recipe. </li>
                <li>Nice to have: Keep the screen awake when viewing a recipe (This was added)</li>
                <li>Nice to have: Scaling of ingredents (This was added)</li>
                <li>Nice to have: Generate PDFs (This is still on the todo list)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This ended up being a react app that lives in an S3 bucket on AWS and stores the recipes in DynamoDB.
                Based on the number of users we have it costs about a dollar a month to host. On the client side we are
                also caching the recipes which drastically reduces calls to AWS. At some point I want to do some more
                work with making this setup more Local First, and also add in PDF generation.</p>
