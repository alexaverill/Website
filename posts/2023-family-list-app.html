            <p>As a family for birthdays and Christmas we had used email chains as a way for people to provide
                wishlists. This worked fine, but ended up being chaotic and hard to follow, so back in 2019 I created a
                next.js app that allowed people to create a wishlist and other family members to claim items on those
                wishlists.</p>
            <p>This app worked great, but it was a bit thrown together and not the easiest to change, with the bigger
                problem being it was a bit of a pain to deploy. It worked without issue for 3 or so years before I came
                back to it and decided to swap over to a more serverless approach.</p>
            <p>I had decided to go serverless because its has very sporadic usage, essentially its mostly used around
                christmas, with a few people adding lists throughout the year for their birthdays. Previously I had it
                running in a VPS which was a fixed cost every month, which meant it cost $60 a year.</p>
            <p>It now runs on AWS using DynamoDB for data storage, and S3 for its hosting, and its costs are now around
                $0.50 a month. (I am splitting the ~$1.00 bill I get from AWS that has both the List app and <a
                    href="./2023-recipe-app.html">the recipe app</a>)</p>
            <p>Its source sode can be found at the <a
                    href="https://github.com/alexaverill/FamilyListAppServerless">Family
                    List App Github</a> and is composed of a React App, NodeJS lambdas and a bunch of Terraform.</p>
