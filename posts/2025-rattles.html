                One fun woodturning project I have been doing on and off over the last couple of years is creating
                wooden rattles as gifts for friends and family with new babies. All of the rattles are finished with
                food safe finish made out of local beeswax and food grade mineral oil.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been creating two different types of rattles, solid rattles filled with beans to get the
                rattling, and captive
                ring rattles.
            </p>

            <p>
                Captive ring rattles are a tricky but satisfying piece that involves cutting individual rings from a
                single piece of
                wood. The rings can then shake up and down the inner shaft, and make a great noise. I created a couple
                different tools
                to create the rings, each one was made out of an existing tool and ground out to try to make it easy to
                shape the rings.

            <p>The filled rattles involve first building out a blank with a hollow space that contains the rattle bits,
                then turning
                that on the lathe. The hollow space is created by gluing different layers of wood together into a
                rectangular blank.
                With these blanks you can mess with combining different species of wood to create nice contrasts and
                patterns.</p>

            <p>
                I’ve tried a variety of different materials to fill the rattles with, and found that metal nuts produce
                the best sound,
                but since those aren't food safe the second best sound has been pinto beans. Since these are being given
                to children I
                was worried about them being easily broken, so I tested the first couple by throwing them across the
                garage onto
                concrete, and throwing them around the house at different surfaces. None of theme broke so I figured
                they are safe
                enough for giving out.
